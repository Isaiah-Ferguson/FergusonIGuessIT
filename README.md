Isaiah Keith Ferguson

This app will promt the user to input a diffuculty setting and then it depenedning on the setting the user will have to guess between certain numbers.


Peer Reviewed by Harrison Busby: "I really liked how Isaiah formatted his code. He used more bools than I used, which was interesting and he used a different integer variable for custom guesses than the other cases in the switch statement (he used regular "guesses" for the other cases besides custom). Overall it played great and worked just as well. Good Job Isaiah! :)
